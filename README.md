# jlox_interpreter
This project is a simple jlox interpreter based on [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)

I did most of CHALLENGES in this book, added some new feauters to the jlox interpreter.

such as:
* The prompt now can be used as a calculator.
* Each variable must be initialized or assigned before first use.
* /* */ Annotation style is supported.
* "," expression is supported.
* Strings can be compared to each other or added to numbers.
